      Ingredients:

      2 cups sushi rice
      2 cups water
      3 tbsp. rice vinegar
      2 tbsp. sugar
      1 tsp. salt
      2 eggs
      4 oz. sashimi-grade salmon
      4 oz. sashimi-grade tuna
      4 oz. sashimi-grade yellowtail
      4 oz. cooked shrimp
      4 oz. thinly sliced omelette
      4 oz. thinly sliced tamagoyaki (sweet omelette)
      1 cup fresh edamame, shelled
      2 nori sheets, cut into thin strips
      Wasabi, soy sauce, and pickled ginger for serving
      Instructions:

      Rinse the sushi rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Drain and transfer to a medium saucepan.
      Add water to the saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed.
      In a small bowl, combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Stir until dissolved.
      Transfer the cooked rice to a large mixing bowl and gently fold in the vinegar mixture. Let cool to room temperature.
      Beat the eggs in a small bowl and scramble in a non-stick skillet over medium heat until set. Cut into small pieces and set aside.
      Cut the sashimi-grade salmon, tuna, and yellowtail into small pieces.
      To assemble, place a portion of the sushi rice on a serving plate. Arrange the sashimi, cooked shrimp, omelette, tamagoyaki, scrambled eggs, and edamame on top of the rice.
      Sprinkle with nori strips. Serve with wasabi, soy sauce, and pickled ginger on the side. Enjoy!
