        Ingredients:
        9 lasagna noodles
        1 lb. ground beef
        1 jar of pasta sauce
        1 egg
        1/2 cup ricotta cheese
        1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
        2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
        Instructions:

        Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
        Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
        In a large skillet, cook ground beef over medium heat until browned. Drain any excess fat.
        Stir in pasta sauce and set aside.
        In a separate bowl, beat the egg and mix in ricotta cheese and Parmesan cheese.
        In a 9x13 inch baking dish, layer 3 cooked lasagna noodles on the bottom.
        Spread a layer of the meat sauce on top of the noodles.
        Spread a layer of the cheese mixture on top of the meat sauce.
        Repeat the layering process two more times, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese on top.
        Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes.
        Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
        Let cool for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!
